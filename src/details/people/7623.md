<!-- Sam Raimi -->

William Thomas, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/evil-dead-ii-review/):

> The gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel/remake [[*Evil Dead 2*](/movies/765)] uses every trick in the cinematic book, and confirms that Bruce Campbell and [director Sam] Raimi are gods.

[The A.V. Club](https://web.archive.org/web/20131215230717/http://www.avclub.com/review/evil-dead-2-dead-by-dawn-widescreen-edition-18785):

> His quick cuts, odd camera angles, and, of course, wild points of view—most notably a Steadicam perversion dubbed ["The Shakycam,"](https://nofilmschool.com/the-shaky-cam-coens-sam-raimi) in which two cameramen run around with the camera mounted on a board—have since become benchmarks by which many quirky films are measured...  Raimi is one of the most deliriously kinetic directors around.

Matt Ford, [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/02/05/evil_dead_2_1987_review.shtml):

> [His] kaleidoscope of stop-motion animation, unbelievable point-of-view shots, trembling hand-held camera, rotating sets, bizarre lighting, and chase scenes has now been endlessly imitated, and pastiches crop up in everything from TV ads to music videos.

Owen Gleiberman, [Bostom Phoenix](https://archive.org/details/sim_boston-phoenix_april-17-23-1987_16_16/page/n65/mode/2up):

> His movies don’t give you the heebiejeebies. They climb the walls all by themselves.
