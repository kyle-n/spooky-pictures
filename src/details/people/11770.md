<!-- John Carpenter -->

Adam Nayman, [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/john-carpenter-is-still-scary):

> The novelist Jonathan Lethem once proposed that the centerpiece sequence of Carpenter’s *They Live* (1988)—in which an ornery drifter, played by the W.W.F. star Roddy (Rowdy) Piper, dons a pair of magical sunglasses and perceives a campaign of subliminal subjugation waged by mind-controlling aliens—should be preserved in a time capsule as the apex of neo-B-movie artistry. 

David Sims, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/10/the-original-halloween-will-never-be-matched/620401/):

> [John] Carpenter’s vision [for [*Halloween*](/movies/948)] was so frightening because it was delivered with so much control. He didn’t need a double-digit body count to communicate the message that got under people’s skin: Suburban life, despite all of its comfortable trappings, offers only the thinnest veneer of safety.
