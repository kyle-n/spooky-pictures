<!-- Sigourney Weaver -->

Mekado Murphy, [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/movies/alien-covenant-influences.html):

> [Sigourney Weaver](/people/10205) as Ripley in the [*Alien* films](/movies/348) made the transition from survivor to full-blown sci-fi action hero. She paved the way for other leading women in space, from Jodie Foster in [*Contact*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884/) to Sandra Bullock in [*Gravity*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/).

David Ehrlich, [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/features/best-of/alien-movies-ranked-worst-to-best-prometheus-covenant-1201817323):

> Ridley Scott‘s 1979 original, [*Alien*](/movies/348)... made Sigourney Weaver an iconic final girl and became the flawless masterpiece all sci-fi horror attempts will inevitably be compared to. Then came James Cameron’s 1986 [*Aliens*](/movies/679), which made Weaver an iconic action hero.
