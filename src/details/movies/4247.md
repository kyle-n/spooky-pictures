> The outer limits of R-rated respectability are stretched, if not shredded, by Keenen Ivory Wayans' gleefully gross and exuberantly smutty *Scary Movie*, a zany scattershot spoof of teen horror pics, high-school sex comedies and assorted pop-culture phenomena.

That the teenagers in the movie are played mostly by actors in their late 20s and 30s--and that the movie comments on this.
