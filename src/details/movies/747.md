<!-- Shaun of the Dead -->

Ann Hornaday, [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45843-2004Sep23.html):

> A horde of staggering, slack-jawed zombies has taken over North London in the course of a weekend. But, considering the usual brain-dead expressions of the neighborhood's working stiffs, skate punks and pub customers, how could anyone tell?

Scott Tobias, [A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/shaun-of-the-dead-1798227310):

> Edgar Wright’s _Shaun Of The Dead_ stands out in a crowded field—for being wittier and better-made that than nearly all [2000s zombie movies], but also for its zombie-movie classicism in the face of all that revisionism.

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shaun-of-the-dead-2004):

> Instead of focusing on the Undead and trying to get the laughs there, it treats the living characters as sitcom regulars whose conflicts and arguments keep getting interrupted by annoying flesh-eaters.

Christy Lemire, [Associated Press](https://www.today.com/id/wbna6074664):

> In a laugh-out-loud sequence, Shaun and Ed defend themselves from zombies in the backyard by throwing albums from Shaun’s collection at their heads. But they do it selectively: Flinging Dire Straits or Sade in the name of survival is acceptable, but not an original pressing of New Order’s _Blue Monday_.
