<!-- Tucker and Dale vs. Evil -->

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tucker-and-dale-vs-evil-2011):

> A van filled with college kids speeds heedlessly down the back roads of hillbilly country. A bearded redneck scowls at them from a pickup truck...
>
> In a clever if sensationally implausible twist, the only vicious character is one of the college kids, the two hillbillies are sweet and helpful guys, and one cliche after another is ticked off and upended.

Brian Tallerico, [HollywoodChicago.com](https://www.hollywoodchicago.com/news/15956/film-review-tucker-dale-vs-evil-perfectly-blends-comedy-with-gore):

> [The college kids become] even more convinced that Tucker & Dale have not only eaten their friend but will hunt them down next. What unfolds is basically a series of events in which really stupid college kids get themselves killed in the company of two freaked-out rednecks. And it’s great.

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tucker-and-dale-vs-evil-2011):

> To describe the results [of the misunderstanding] would be cheating, but let’s say fans of gruesome violence won’t be disappointed.

Ian Buckwalter, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2011/09/29/140854152/tucker-dale-vs-evil-deliver-ance-us-yall):

>  The comedy is broad, but [Alan] Tudyk and [Tyler] Labine do well in a tough assignment, never stooping to the easy, overt slack-jawed yokel caricatures that might have laced any laughter at their foibles with guilt.
