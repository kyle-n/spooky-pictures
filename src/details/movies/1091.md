<!-- The Thing -->

Adam Smith, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/thing-2-review/):

> *The Thing* is a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror, placing 12 men at an Antarctic station while a shapeshifter takes them over one by one. 

Anton Bitel, [Little White Lies](https://lwlies.com/articles/john-carpenter-the-thing-blu-ray-review/):

> *The Thing* is set in an all-male environment, and is as much a study of masculinity in crisis as an update of the sort of siege scenario that [[John] Carpenter](/people/11770) had already played out in *Assault on Precinct 13*.

> [The movie] is a very modern witch hunt, as the station’s men attempt to weed out any trace of that [alien] femininity from their ranks.

Sebastián Martínez Díaz, [Film Cred](https://film-cred.com/john-carpenter-the-thing-movie/):

> This tale of an amorphous alien represents the unease that was held for Soviet infiltration of American soil during the Cold War.

Wael Khairy, [RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/why-the-thing-is-one-of-the-most-effective-horror-movies-ever-made):

> This underlying sense of uncertainty is even present in Ennio Morricone’s score. It plays like an eerie heartbeat to the impending doom lurking inside Outpost 31.

Sean Wilson, [D&C Film](https://www.devon-cornwall-film.co.uk/2010/10/31/the-thing-1982-retrospective-review-is-that-a-man-in-there/):

> Few horror films are so relentlessly cryptic - and relentlessly bleak.
