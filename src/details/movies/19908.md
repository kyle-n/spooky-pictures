<!-- Zombieland -->

Chris Hewitt, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/zombieland-review/#):

> *Zombieland* takes place in an unabashed fantasy world where little old ladies can crush zombies with grand pianos, Looney Tunes-style, and where the zombie apocalypse is merely an excuse for four characters to have the run of America, driving around like they own the place, wallowing in luxury mansions and – occasionally – bumping into, and summarily dispatching, some zombies.

Bruce Diones, [New Yorker](https://web.archive.org/web/20091021040456/https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/zombieland_fleischer):

> Woody Harrelson has a rip-roaring time in this comic splatterfest as a redneck from hell who is out to kill zombies. It’s the kind of genre acting that doesn’t get much notice, but it’s a gleeful rampage of a performance.

Michael Phillips, [Chicago Tribune](https://archive.is/woMNm#selection-1861.55-1861.92):

> It’s 81 minutes of my kind of stupid.

Nigel Andrews, [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a840b986-b352-11de-ae8d-00144feab49a):

> It is frothy and forgettable, and, like any black comedy, funny even, or especially, when it shouldn’t be.
