<!-- The Addams Family -->

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-addams-family-1991):

> The movie, based on characters created by [Charles] Addams in his immortal New Yorker cartoons, and on the early 1960s TV series, looks uncannily like the original Addams drawings.

Daryl Sparkles, [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/30-years-since-the-addams-family-hit-the-big-screen-it-is-still-the-perfect-blend-of-horror-and-comedy-172042):

> [Gomez] is definitely a Renaissance man: just as skilled with a rapier sword as he is with a golf club, his dance moves are unparalleled. The late Raul Julia plays [him] to perfection.

Angie Errigo, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/addams-family-review/#):

> Magnificent Anjelica Huston might have been born for Addams' Morticia. She's like a long drink of contaminated water.

Rita Kempley, [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/theaddamsfamilypg13kempley_a0a280.htm):

> Eleven-year-old [Christina] Ricci is a revelation as the morbidly fascinating Wednesday. The kid was born deadpan.

Marc Savlov, [Austin Chronicle](https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1991-11-29/the-addams-family/):

> With her toy guillotine and collection of (naturally) headless dolls, she is the youthful heart of this strangely endearing brood.
