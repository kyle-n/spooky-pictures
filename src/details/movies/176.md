<!-- Saw -->

Kim Newman, [Empire](https://web.archive.org/web/20121113224054/https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=10234):

> *Saw*, ingeniously co-scripted by Whannell and debuting director [James Wan](/people/2127), is styled like early David Fincher and boasts an intricate structure - complex flashbacks-within-flashbacks explain how the characters have come to this crisis - and a satisfying mystery to go with its ghastly claustrophobia.

Peter Bradshaw, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/oct/01/horror):

> There's something impressively loathsome and extravagantly twisted about this horror-thriller.

Scott Tobias, [A.V. Club](https://web.archive.org/web/20131223084652/https://www.avclub.com/review/saw-4846):

> Though dumber than a box of rocks, *Saw* forges ahead with the kind of conviction and energy that will keep bad-cinema junkies sitting bolt upright.

Jordan Crucchiola, [Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/every-saw-movie-ranked.html):

> [T]he original Saw is practically quaint compared to the rest of the series, which levels up the gore and transforms the simple starting plot into a Byzantine rat maze of interlocking and overlapping narratives... and itâ€™s still the best.

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/saw-2004):

> *Saw* is well made and acted, and does what it does about as well as it could be expected to. Horror fans may forgive its contrivances.
