David Ehrlich, [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/features/best-of/alien-movies-ranked-worst-to-best-prometheus-covenant-1201817323):

>  There are like four things that happen in *Alien* — it runs two full hours and it’s one of the best films of all time.

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-alien-1979):

> One of the great strengths of *Alien* is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits.

Manohla Dargis, [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-oct-29-et-dargis29-story.html):

> Of all the monsters to go bump in the endless night of the movies, few have been as wonderfully frightening as the creature from *Alien*.

Kim Newman, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/alien-review/):

> Some favour [James Cameron's gung-ho sequel](/movies/679), but in duplicating the alien for shoot-'em-up potential, it serves only to highlights the reserve and purity of the original.

Jamie Russell, [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/10/27/alien_directors_cut_2003_review.shtml):

> [The movie] lays down the seeds of the *Alien* mythology, obsessively toying with themes of birth, motherhood and sex in quite outrageous ways.
