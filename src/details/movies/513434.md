<!-- One Cut of the Dead -->

Simon Abrams, [RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/one-cut-of-the-dead-movie-review-2019):

> *One Cut of the Dead* requires some patience. It begins as a visually flat, mostly by-the-numbers zombie comedy about a low-budget film crew who are menaced by zombies in real time while filming a zombie movie.

Richard Kuipers, [Variety](https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/one-cut-of-the-dead-review-1202800409/):

> Writer-director-editor Shinichiro Ueda’s cleverly conceived and executed debut feature opens with an unbroken 37-minute shot of monster mayhem before hitting the reset button and turning into a funny satire of low-budget genre filmmaking — and eventually becoming a charming family comedy-drama.

Carlos Aguilar, [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-09-12/one-cut-of-the-dead-review-japanese-horror-comedy):

> A master class in endless narrative inventiveness and an ode to the resourceful and collaborative spirit of hands-on filmmaking, *One Cut of the Dead* amounts to an explosively hilarious rarity.

David Ehrlich, [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/one-cut-of-the-dead-review-zombie-comedy-fantasia-fest-1201990760/):

> Drunk on its own DIY energy and deeply in love with everything it’s doing, *One Cut of the Dead* is a euphoric ode to the chaos (and compromises) of genre filmmaking; it’s the kind of movie that makes you want to pick up a camera, call some friends, and shoot the end of the world on your own terms.
