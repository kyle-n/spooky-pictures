> An iconic spectacle that supplants the haunted horror of the [previous film](/movies/348) with a sense of overwhelming danger, *Aliens* unfolds like a PTSD flashback of the nightmare that Ripley improbably survived the first time around.

Mekado Murphy, [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/movies/alien-covenant-influences.html):

> [Sigourney Weaver](/people/10205) as Ripley in the *Alien* films made the transition from survivor to full-blown sci-fi action hero. She paved the way for other leading women in space, from Jodie Foster in [*Contact*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884/) to Sandra Bullock in [*Gravity*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/).
