<!-- Evil Dead 2 -->

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/evil-dead-2-dead-by-dawn-1987):

> *Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn* is a comedy disguised as a blood-soaked shock-a-rama.

Owen Gleiberman, [Bostom Phoenix](https://archive.org/details/sim_boston-phoenix_april-17-23-1987_16_16/page/n65/mode/2up):

> *Evil Dead 2* is the horror equivalent of the hardest drugs there are: it bypasses logic and heads straight for your pleasure centers.

William Thomas, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/evil-dead-ii-review/):

> The gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel/remake uses every trick in the cinematic book, and confirms that Bruce Campbell and [[director Sam] Raimi](/people/7623) are gods.

Matt Ford, [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/02/05/evil_dead_2_1987_review.shtml):

> [The movie] soon forgets the confines of horror, and whirls off into a strange, almost hallucinogenic cartoon nightmare of flying eyeballs, bleeding walls, and possessed limbs.

Richard Harrington, [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/evildead2deadbydawnnrharrington_a0aa40.htm):

> Campbell's own right hand [becomes] possessed... Finally solving his problem with a chainsaw, Campbell imprisons the wayward hand under a trash can weighed down with a copy of *A Farewell to Arms*.

Wilson Chapman, [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/features/best-of/best-horror-films-all-time-1235041390/):

> *Evil Dead II* recognizes that comedy and horror are fundamentally the same, a model of storytelling concerned with excess and provoking instinctive primal reactions, and delivers one of cinemaâ€™s most visceral thrill rides in the process.
