> A daring film crew, armed with crucifixes and guarantees of safety, sets out to record the daily lives of four vampire housemates in *What We Do in the Shadows*, a goofily amusing mockumentary from the New Zealand comedians and actors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi.

> Vladislav (Clement), Viago (Waititi), Deacon (Jonathan Brugh) and Petyr (Ben Fransham) spend a fair amount of time squabbling over chores and housekeeping. Several funny bits feature Viago, the neat freak, griping about Petyr’s failure to clean up the human spinal column left outside the stone crypt he lives in, or gently reminding his other roommates to put towels down on the good couch before chomping on victims.

> Clement is suitably magnetic as the would-be Lothario Vlad, but it’s Waititi, as possibly filmdom’s most courteous vampiric host to date, who steals the show.
