<!-- Hotel Transylvania -->

Alonso Duralde, [The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/hotel-transylvania-review-tickle-me-dracula-58371/):

> After the death of his beloved wife, Count Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) vows to protect their daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) from the savage cruelties of mankind, so he builds the titular resort, a lavish castle where Frankenstein (Kevin James), Wayne the werewolf (Steve Buscemi), Murray the mummy (CeeLo Green) and Griffin the invisible man (David Spade) can relax, take a shvitz and enjoy repulsive, insect-packed gourmet cuisine.

Bilge Ebiri, [Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/movie-review-hotel-transylvania.html):

> Directed by the Russian animator Genndy Tartakovsky, who has a bit of a following thanks to TV shows like *Samurai Jack* and *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*, [this] slight, simple tale has sharp, speedy animation that keeps its mostly uninspired plot moving along.

Jordan Hoffman, [ScreenCrush](https://screencrush.com/hotel-transylvania-review/):

> Listen: I am a very immature man. When I hear Adam Sandler as a bat go "bluh bluh bluh-bluh" something in my heart sings.
