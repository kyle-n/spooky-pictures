R. Kurt Osenlund, [Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/youre-next/):

> Working from a script by frequent collaborator Simon Barrett, [director Adam] Wingard quickly establishes his conceit, brazenly merging the home-invasion thriller with the dysfunctional family dramedy.

Joshua Rothkopf, [Time Out](https://web.archive.org/web/20130826042216/https://www.timeout.com/us/film/youre-next-movie-review):

> _Youâ€™re Next_ is a throwback, this time to the smarty-pants verbosity of the [_Scream_](/movies/4232) era: In a shadowy rural mansion, a wealthy, bickering clan and several bitchy houseguests are brutally targeted by mysterious crossbow-wielding strangers.

Marrc Savlov, [Austin Chronicle](https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2013-08-23/you-re-next/):

> Onscreen family bickering has rarely felt this real, or been this funny, in any film of late, much less a horror show.
