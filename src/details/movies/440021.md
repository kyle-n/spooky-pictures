> I’d be shocked to read a review of *Happy Death Day* that didn’t say, “It’s *Groundhog Day* meets *Scream*!”

K. Austin Collins, [The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2017/10/13/16469734/happy-death-day-film-review-blumhouse-horror-christopher-b-landon):

> The movie starts off all horror and gore, with Tree getting stalked, chased, and stabbed over and over until she catches on to the fact that what’s happening isn’t merely déjà vu. But when she does catch on, the movie becomes peppier, even upbeat.

> If anything, this movie feels like more of an upbeat college movie by the end, with its dashes of comedy, than it does an outright horror movie.

> Tree, the time-looping heroine of *Happy Death Day* played by Jessica Rothe... is (as she'd probably cop to herself) a bit of a bitch — a flaky, catty, blonde sorority girl who helps enforce a harsh social hierarchy in which she occupies a prime perch.

> Tree sets out to discover who wants her dead. In doing so, she realizes that she’s been a shit to so many people that she can’t easily deduce whom her killer might be.

> [T]he film... overturns some of [horror]'s more puritanical tendencies by focusing on the sort of character whose death would traditionally be presented as an extreme but deserved kind of comeuppance, because surviving these sorts of stories is a reward reserved for the nice, the pure, and — occasionally — the comic relief.
