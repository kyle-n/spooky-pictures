Jason Zinoman, [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/movies/halloween-1978-review.html):

> The original *Halloween* always struck me as an experimental art film in a bloody exploitation mask.

> The marketable standby of a killer stalking scantily clad women is elevated by elegantly orchestrated camerawork that keeps you disoriented, moment by moment, as the beating notes of the soundtrack remind you something bad and unstoppable is on the way.
>
> From the first shot to the last, this movie is confidently guided by a specific and committed vision.

Braden Timmons, [The Streamr](https://thestreamr.com/2023/10/31/halloween-45-years-of-terror/):

> The antagonist of *Halloween*, Michael Myers, is terrifying. Not just because he is someone who walks in and out of houses killing people – it’s the enigma of the being that makes this character so horrifying.

Jason Zinoman, [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/movies/halloween-1978-review.html):

> Michael Myers is not like other movie monsters. He doesn’t lurch or creep or race. He walks, steadily. His physicality and clothes tell you nothing about him. He never speaks and offers no hint of a motivation for his killing spree. He is not a character so much as an absence of one.

David Sims, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/10/the-original-halloween-will-never-be-matched/620401/):

> [John] Carpenter’s vision was so frightening because it was delivered with so much control. He didn’t need a double-digit body count to communicate the message that got under people’s skin: Suburban life, despite all of its comfortable trappings, offers only the thinnest veneer of safety.

Chris Hewitt, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/halloween-review/):

> Jamie Lee Curtis is terrific in her debut film role.
