<!-- Scream (1996) -->

Adam Smith, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/scream-review/#):

> What director [Wes] Craven, creator of possibly the most distinguished kiddie mangler of shock-flick history, Freddy Krueger, does with the twitching corpse of the [slasher] genre is to turn it into a kind of chaotic post-modern pyjama party, with the imperilled teens constantly remarking on the similarities of what's going on to every slasher ever made...

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/scream-1996):

> *Scream* is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those cans that heats its own soup.

Adam Smith, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/scream-review/#):

> In less talented hands this could have been a lumpen disaster... Craven succeeds not only because of an intimate knowledge of the type of movie he created... but because of a capacity to leap with balletic deftness from exuberant in-jokery... to ball-retracting moments of terror.

Kevin Thomas, [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-12-20-ca-10835-story.html):

> Writer Kevin Williamson, who clearly knows the genre inside out, and Craven succeed in keeping us guessing the identity of the killer and suspecting literally everyone, even Sidney, at one time or another.

Tom Charity, [Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/movies/scream):

> Craven throws in half a dozen of Hollywood's brightest hopefuls: [Neve] Campbell in the central role of the teenager haunted by the murder of her mother; [David] Arquette as a naive local deputy; [Courtney] Cox as a TV star; [Rose] McGowan as the doomed best friend; and [Skeet] Ulrich as the evocatively named Billy Loomis.
