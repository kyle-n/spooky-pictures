> *Nightcrawler*, a fantastic, sleek and... fun satire shows us what the physical embodiment of uncontrolled capitalism would look like. It would look like an underfed, raccoon-faced Jake Gyllenhaal zooming around Los Angeles in the middle of the night.

Emily St. James, [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/12/5/7340681/nightcrawler-jake-gyllenhaal):

> Lou [(Jake Gyllenhaal)] finds out about freelance cameramen who go looking for moments of human misery — the aftermath of violent crimes and accidents, mostly — that he can then turn around for the early morning news on local stations. He quickly proves adept at the task, crossing boundaries and putting his camera right in victims’ faces, until he’s shooed away like an insect.

> He’s a terrible human being, but he creates must-see TV.

Christopher Orr, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/nightcrawler-review/382170/):

> You have to begin with the eyes. They’ve always been Gyllenhaal’s most distinctive feature, but in *Nightcrawler* they're like parabolic antennae, wide and unblinking, attuned to any signal, however faint.

Emily St. James, [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/12/5/7340681/nightcrawler-jake-gyllenhaal):

> *Nightcrawler* is a parable of bitter, burbling resentment, of people who think they deserve certain things just because of the accident of birth, and of a society that is simply too tired to deny them everything.
