Andrew O'Hehir, [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2015/03/12/it_follows_an_instant_horror_classic_about_the_dark_side_of_teen_sex/):

> From the very first frames of the movie – do not get there late! – [director David Robert Mitchell] builds a terrifying atmosphere.

Eric Kohn, [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/culture/cannes-review-it-follows-is-a-teen-horror-movie-like-youve-never-seen-it-before-26132/):

> Mitchell pairs his believable ensemble with a dreamlike world that resembles their perspective of reality. Aside from the ghastly being that takes on numerous appearances as it stalks Jay around town, the movie features no prominent adult characters.

Simon Abrams, [RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/it-follows-2015):

> _It Follows_ is not really about sex, but an unbearable, unsinkable mood that descends when you come of age, and never completely dissipates, not even after climactic sexual, or other violent acts.

Stephen Holden, [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/13/movies/review-in-it-follows-a-shape-shifting-horror-stalks-a-teenager.html?):

> Clues to the source and motives of this menace are dropped, but they don’t add up. Like the evil in a David Lynch horror film, it is out there in the night, waiting to get you.

Peter Bradshaw, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/26/it-follows-review-horror-sex-death):

> I love the title: a clear, deadpan, pitiless description, rather like the insect horror _They Nest_ (2000). They did, and it does.
