Keith Uhlich, [Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/movies/psycho-1):

> Where would we be without *Psycho*? Fifty years on and [Alfred Hitchcock]’s delicious cod-Freudian nightmare about a platinum-blonde embezzler (Janet Leigh) who neglected to consult a guide before selecting her motel still has much to answer for. It blazed a bloody trail for the much-loved slasher cycle, but it also assured us that a B-movie could be A-grade in quality and innovation.

Bill Weber, [Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/psycho/):

> [A] landmark in film history.

Richard Brody, [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-greatness-of-psycho):

Andrew Sarris, [Village Voice](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-greatness-of-psycho):

> *Psycho* should be seen at least three times by any discerning film-goer, the first time for the sheer terror of the experience, and on this occasion I fully agree with Hitchcock that only a congenital spoilsport would reveal the plot; the second time for the macabre comedy inherent in the conception of the film; and the third for all the hidden meanings and symbols lurking beneath the surface.

Peter John Dyer, [Sight and Sound](https://archive.org/details/Sight_and_Sound_1960_10_BFI_GB/page/n43/mode/2up) (1960):

> An aura of nightmare embraces the whole cast. An innocent-seeming old lady in a hardware store is heard asking for painless insecticide; hayforks form a menacing, serpentine crown round the head of the dead girl’s sister.

> Of course, it is a very minor work.
