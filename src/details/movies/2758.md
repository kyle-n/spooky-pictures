<!-- Addams Family Values -->

David Sims, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/11/addams-family-values-thanksgiving-movie/576190/):

> *Addams Family Values*, a sequel that turns 25 years old this week, remains the pinnacle of the [Thanksgiving movie]—even if none of the characters ever sits down for a turkey dinner. The film is a perfect cup of dry cider with just the barest undertone of sweetness.

Lee Escobedo, [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/addams-family-adaptations-ranked/):

> The film's standout subplot centers on Wednesday ([Christina] Ricci) and her brother Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) being forced to attend a summer camp where their gore-loving outsider ways clash with the "normie" campers.

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/addams-family-values-1993):

> What is most beguiling about *Addams Family Values* is the way the relationship between Gomez and Morticia has ripened. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are given a lot of one-liners and payoff gags, of course, but what's funny is the stuff that comes in between - the real affection with which they embrace each other, and the way they delight in their unspeakable lifestyle.

David Sims, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/11/addams-family-values-thanksgiving-movie/576190/):

> The Addamses are ridiculous, monstrous, and practically unkillable, yet they’re one of cinema’s most loving portrayals of a family unit. Each member is ultimately accepting of the others’ idiosyncrasies, fighting back against outside attempts to smother their collective strangeness.
