<!-- Beau Is Afraid -->

Barry Hertz, [The Globe and Mail](https://archive.is/AhVgW#selection-2341.0-2350.0):

> *Beau Is Afraid* is not a movie for everyone – actually, it is a movie for very, very, very few. But I just happen to be part of that teeny tiny target audience. And for me, *Beau Is Afraid* kills.

David Sims, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/04/beau-is-afraid-movie-review-ari-aster/673730/):

> The film shares some of the unsettling horror of Aster’s first two films, [*Hereditary*](/movies/493922) and [*Midsommar*](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/530385-midsommar), but I’d call *Beau Is Afraid* a more straightforward comedy—as long as the idea of *Looney Tunes* crossed with [*Portnoy’s Complaint*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portnoy%27s_Complaint) sounds funny to you.

Donald Clarke, [Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2023/05/17/beau-is-afraid-joaquin-phoenix-bosses-this-vast-hilarious-film-but-you-may-well-hate-it/):

> Early on, Beau sets out to take medication that, a doctor warns, absolutely must be accompanied by water. Of course the taps aren’t working. And, after fighting his way to the shop through feral street people, he discovers he has no money for bottled water. A quick search on the internet for the results of waterless consumption brings him fleetingly to an obituary...

> It’s not that the laughter is set against the despair. It is the despair itself that is so funny – so absurd, so pointless, so pathetic.

David Ehrlich, [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/beau-is-afraid-review-ari-aster-1234827032/):

> Anyone who would sooner die for their mom than answer the phone when she calls should probably mix a few Zoloft into their popcorn just to be safe.
