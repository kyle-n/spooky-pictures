> It's mulch ado about a killer cabbage that makes slaw out of a florist's customers in *Little Shop of Horrors*, a hybrid of the stage musical and the cult movie classic from which it sprouted.

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/little-shop-of-horrors-1986):

> All of the wonders of *Little Shop of Horrors* are accomplished with an offhand, casual charm. The movie doesn't labor its jokes or insist on its virtuoso special effects, but devotes its energies to seeming unforced and delightful.

Paul Attanasio, [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/littleshopofhorrorspg13attanasio_a0ad85.htm):

> *Little Shop* has an old-fashioned style and a new-fashioned sense of humor -- by which I mean a man-eating plant, a sadistic dentist, a masochist who goes to the dentist for fun and David Letterman-style parodies of the early '60s.

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/little-shop-of-horrors-1986):

> Steve Martin almost steals the show as [the] sadistic, motorcycle-riding dentist.
