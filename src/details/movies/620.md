<!-- Ghostbusters -->

Roger Ebert, [Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ghostbusters-1984):

> [Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis are] funny, but they're not afraid to reveal that they're also quick-witted and intelligent; their dialogue puts nice little spins on American clichÃ©s, and it uses understatement, irony, in-jokes, vast cynicism, and cheerful goofiness. Rarely has a movie this expensive provided so many quotable lines.

Janet Maslin, [New York Times](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1984/06/08/246115.html?pageNumber=53):

> When all three are booted out of Columbia University, they go into private practice, advertising on television and setting up shop in an abandoned Manhattan firehouse, since they like sliding down the pole.

Gene Siskel, [Chicago Tribune](https://web.archive.org/web/20200202130256/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2014-02-24-chi-ghostbuster-review-gene-siskel-020140224-story.html):

> *Ghostbusters* is the movie that confirms Bill Murray as one of our funniest comic actors.

Arthur Knight, [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/ghostbusters-thrs-1984-review-748028/):

> Throughout the film the special effects people, headed by Richard Edlund, have obviously had a ball, transforming a little old lady in the New York public library into a howling Banshee, or wrecking the interior of a hotel ballroom with laser beams as the ghostbusters pursue a particularly voracious fuzz green phantom.

Caroline Westbrook, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/ghostbusters-review/):

> It hits the target every single time - the jokes, the chemistry onscreen, and the effects all fall into place.
