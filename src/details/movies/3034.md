<!-- Young Frankenstein -->

Adam Smith, [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/young-frankenstein-review/):

> *Young Frankenstein* is a marvellously crafted, beautifully shot comedic homage to [James Whale’s 1931 classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein_(1931_film)), with the sheer craft of the production and performances contrasting brilliantly with the low-down and dirty obviousness of many of the gags.

Roger Ebert, [The Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/young-frankenstein-1974):

> [Mel Brooks'] movies weren’t just funny, they were aggressive and subversive, making us laugh even when we really should have been offended. (Explaining this process, Brooks once loftily declared, “My movies rise below vulgarity.”) 

Pauline Kael, [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/12/30/a-magnetic-blur):

> Gene Wilder stares at the world with nearsighted, pale-blue-eyed wonder; he was born with a comic’s flyblown wig and the look of a reddish creature from outer space. His features aren’t distinct; his personality lacks definition. His whole appearance is so fuzzy and weak he’s like mist on the lens. Yet since his first screen appearance, as the mortician in *Bonnie and Clyde*, he’s made his presence felt each time. He’s a magnetic blur.
